# No Skill Drain

This does the exact same as if you would die twice within
short period of time, where also no skill drain is active
as a buf. The difference is that this mod doesn't need
the buff active, but will just adjust the skill lowering
on death.

Optionally you can also change the config value that is set to -100 (%) per default.
Values bigger -100 will act as a multiplier to the skill drain.
